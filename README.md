The Chamilo Shell ("Chash") is a command-line PHP tool meant to speed up the management of (multiple)
Chamilo portals under Linux.

Installation
====================

    git clone https://github.com/chamilo/chash.git
    cd chash
    composer install

Note: If you don't have Composer installed, check http://getcomposer.org/download/

Usage
====================

Here are a few examples of how you can use Chash:

In a Chamilo installation folder located in "/var/www/chamilo"

    cd /var/www/chamilo
    php /path/chash/chash.php chamilo:status

    Chamilo $_configuration info:
    Chamilo $_configuration[root_web]: http://localhost/chamilo-1.8.7.1-stable/
    Chamilo $_configuration[root_sys]: /var/www/chamilo-1.8.7.1-stable/
    Chamilo $_configuration[main_database]: chamilo18777_chamilo_main
    Chamilo $_configuration[db_host]: localhost
    Chamilo $_configuration[db_user]: root
    Chamilo $_configuration[db_password]: root
    Chamilo $_configuration[single_database]:
    Chamilo $_configuration[db_glue]: `.`
    Chamilo $_configuration[table_prefix]:

    Chamilo database settings:
    Chamilo setting_current['chamilo_database_version']: 1.9.0.18715
    Chamilo $_configuration[system_version]: 1.9.6


Inside a chamilo folder execute db:sql_cli in order to enter to the SQL client of the Chamilo database:

    php /path/chash.php db:sql_cli --conf=main/inc/conf/configuration.php

If you have configured Chash globally (see below), from any Chamilo directory:

    chash translation:disable french


Building the chash.phar file
====================

This procedure is only required once, and is generally for developers. If you update chash frequently, you'll have to go through this each time you update, but never more than that.

You need to have curl (in order to download packages required to build chash.phar)

    apt-get install php5-curl

If you don't have composer installed on your computer, you can just do the following to download and install it and run the command above (make sure you have PHP5 enabled on the command line):

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php5 composer.phar update --no-dev --prefer-dist

In order to generate the executable chash.phar file. You have to set first this php setting (in your cli php configuration file).

For example in Ubuntu /etc/php5/cli/php.ini

    phar.readonly = Off

(or you can also use the "-d phar.readonly=0" option as described below)

You need to download the required third parties libraries via composer (this might take a few minutes):

    cd chash
    composer update --no-dev --prefer-dist

Then you can call the php createPhar.php file. A new chash.phar file will be created.

In detail:

    cd chash
    composer update --no-dev
    php -d phar.readonly=0 createPhar.php

If you're using php 5.3 with suhosin, the phar will not be executed. You can try this:

    php -d suhosin.executor.include.whitelist="phar" chash.phar

or you can change this setting in your /etc/php5/cli/conf.d/suhosin.ini file
(look for "executor"), although this might increase the vulnerability of your
system. The location of the file may vary depending on your operating system.


Make it global
====================

To get the most out of Chash, you should move the chash.phar file to
(or link from) your /usr/local/bin directory. You can do this getting inside
the directory where you put chash.phar and doing:

    chmod +x chash.phar
    sudo ln -s /path/to/chash.phar /usr/local/bin/chash

Then you can launch chash by moving into any Chamilo installation directory and
typing

    chash

It will give you the details of the commands you can use to run it properly.

The most useful command to us until now has been the "chash db:sql_cli" command,
which puts you directly into a MySQL client session.
